## Design Background

</div>

Due to the deterioration of the environment, the occurrence of extreme weather is getting more frequently, which is closely related to continuous industrial development by human beings. It is due to the neglection of protection to the ecological environment that many species lost their habitat. Hence, how to awaken people to protect animals has become one of the essential issues in this era.

Compared to making the minds of adults change, cultivating the next generation, who represents the future, to respect the ecological balance is far more vital. Also, the teenager and children are more willing to accept some fresh thoughts. Hence, we devote ourselves to designing the app for the group of children and teenagers.

## What we aim to do?

Our design aims to make ACT teenagers be aware of protecting the Flora and Fauna around them and promote the concept of harmonious coexistence between people and nature.

Australia is a land which is famous for the biodiversity of both flora and fauna. However, some people, especially teenagers may know little about the concrete information of the animals and plants. If they do not have basic knowledge of the species, it is quite hard to make them be willing to have further ideas to protect the species. 

## Why we design it as a game?

<p>Considering our target audience is the group of children and teenager, we hold the view that the traditional mode of inputting knowledge, such as paper books or a visit to museum, might not make them feel interested.</p>
Combining the games with education may leave a deeper impression on them. Therefore, we will take gaming as the main function of the app, while education and social media can also be realized in it. Teenagers using the app are able to be close to the nature , enrich knowledge about flora and fauna, learn the propensity of endangered animals and make friends with peers when using the application.

## About the datasets
- [Canberra Nature Map - ala.org.au](https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/dr1947) is one of the basic datasets that we are necessary to utilize in this application. It is a repository for park care groups, volunteers and members of the public to report sightings of rare and endangered plant species and any of the many treasures in Canberra's nature parks. In our design, a map with the placement of endangered species is necessary because user needs to be instructed to find the endangered species in a certain area. This dataset provides us with the valuable information about the endangered plants. Then, the potential area where the endangered plants emerge will be demonstrated on the map, which brings a larger possibility to the users to find the plants.

-  [Canberra Nature Map](https://canberra.naturemapr.org/) brings us with partial inspiration. It is a forum for the amateurs who are interested in the animals and insects. Bloggers capture the picture of animals and uploaded it on this website. Also, it provides the user with the potential location where the species live. It seems that adults are the main audience of this website. However, we believe that the teenagers can also participate in this activity. We design the app in a bright color to attract the teenagers. At the same time, capturing the flora and fauna in a game mode can make teenagers feel not bored. Our own design aims to combine the education of common knowledge with gaming. 

- [Canberra Nature Map](https://www.data.act.gov.au/dataset/Threatened-Fauna-Habitat/dkn6-f5xe)provides another part of biological information about the fauna to us. This dataset shows habitat / locations of mammals listed as threatened in the ACT. With this dataset, we can collect the potential locations of the threatened animals. With the same way, the area will be marked or noted in the map of our application. The name of the species is also presented in the dataset, their name can also be searched in our search function. Hence, this dataset plays an important role in our design.
